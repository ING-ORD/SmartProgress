For many people, information technology (IT) is ==basically== ==synonymous== with the guys and ==gals== you call when you need help with a computer issue. ==While== ==that== view ==of== information technology isn’t ==totally== ==wrong==, it ==drastically== ==understates== ==the scope== ==of== this critical ==career== field.

If you’re looking to get a ==better== ==handle== ==on== what information technology is and the many ==facets== of this field, ==then== you’ve come to the right ==place==. We’ve done the ==digging== for you and ==spoke== with IT industry ==pros== to create this ==helpful== beginner’s guide to the field.

## What is information technology and what does it ==encompass==?

The most basic information technology ==definition== is that it's the application of technology to ==solve== business or organizational problems on a ==broad== ==scale==. No ==matter== the role, a ==member== of ==an== IT department works with others to ==solve== technology problems, ==both== big and small.

There are ==three== ==primary== ==pillars== ==of== ==responsibility== for an IT department:

1. **IT ==governance==:** This ==refers== to the combination ==of== ==policies== and processes ==that== ==ensure== IT systems are ==effectively== run and in ==alignment== with the organization’s needs.
2. **IT operations:** This is a ==catchall== category for the daily work of ==an== IT department. This includes ==providing== tech support, network ==maintenance==, security testing and device management ==duties==.
3. **Hardware and infrastructure:** This ==focus== ==area== ==refers== to all the physical components ==of== IT infrastructure. This ==pillar== ==of== IT includes the setup and ==maintenance== of ==equipment== like routers, servers, phone systems and individual devices like laptops.

==Even== ==though== an organization’s IT department ==handles== many ==different== functions and plays a critical role in ==keeping== things running, Andrey Prokopchuk, head ==of== IT at [Belitsoft](https://belitsoft.com/), says the perfect IT department is the one you ==aren’t== even ==aware== ==of==. This ==means== ==that== they are ==able== to automate and create processes for many of ==their== ==daily== tasks, so that the business continues to run ==smoothly==. The ideal IT department is also ==aligned== with the business’s goals and ==transparent== in its processes in a way that the ==rest== of the business can understand and provide input on.

## Why is information technology ==important==?

==Simply== put, the work of most organizations ==would== ==slow== to a ==crawl== without functioning IT systems. You’d be ==hard-pressed== to find a business that doesn’t at ==least== ==partially== ==rely== on computers and the networks that connect ==them==. ==Maintaining== a standard level of service, security and connectivity is a ==huge== task, but it’s not the only priority or ==potential== challenge on ==their== ==plates==.

More and more companies want to implement more intuitive and ==sophisticated== ==solutions==. “IT can provide the ==edge== a company needs to ==outsmart==, ==outpace== and ==out-deliver== ==competitors==,” says Edward Kiledjian, a ==Chief== Information Security Officer and [technology blogger](https://www.kiledjian.com/). Let’s ==take== a look at the needs that current and future IT specialists ==will be== working on:

- **Data overload:** Businesses need to process ==huge== ==amounts== of data. This requires ==large== ==amounts== of processing power, ==sophisticated== software and human analytical skills.
- **Mobile and ==wireless== usages:** More ==employers== are ==offering== remote work options that require smartphones, tablets and laptops with wireless ==hotspots== and ==roaming== ==ability==.
- **Cloud services:** Most businesses no longer operate ==their== ==own== “==server farms==” to store massive ==amounts== of data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain ==that== data.
- **==Bandwidth== for video hosting:** Videoconferencing ==solutions== have ==become== more and more popular, so more network ==bandwidth== is needed to support them ==sufficiently==.

==Based== on the volume of these needs, you probably won’t be too ==surprised== to learn that ==employment== of computer and information technology ==occupations== is ==projected== to ==grow== 13 percent from 2016 to 2026, ==which== is faster ==than== the ==average== for all ==occupations==, ==according== to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm).*

## Hardware vs. software

You know that working with hardware and software is a ==large== part of an IT department’s work, but what ==counts== as hardware? And what’s software? Let’s break down this ==important== ==distinction==.

Hardware includes all the physical parts of a computer system. This includes hardware installed ==inside== the computer like the motherboard, central processing unit and hard drive. Hardware also ==describes== components ==that== can be connected to the ==outside== of a computer like a keyboard, mouse and printer. ==Keep in mind== ==though== that ==some== tablets and ==smaller== laptops integrate items like a keyboard and a mouse ==within== the device. Basically, hardware is any part, component or device related to computers and ==their== networks that you can physically touch and manipulate.

==Unlike== hardware, software is not ==something== you can physically change. Software ==encompasses== all the data, application and programs ==stored== electronically, like an operating system or a video-editing tool.

==So== how does this distinction apply to an IT ==career==? ==Nearly== every IT job requires a ==blend== of hardware and ==software-based== ==know-how==. ==Some== IT workers ==may== ==spend== more time working with configuring hardware components, but ==those== components are also ==governed== by software. ==Additionally==, IT professionals are ==responsible== for deploying and ==setting up== software applications for users.

## IT ==career== ==opportunities==

Now that you know the ==general== ==responsibilities== of an IT department, you may be ==wondering== what the individual roles ==within== are. ==Here== are ==some== of the positions that you’ll find in many IT departments:

- **Computer support specialists** work on the front lines troubleshooting any technology ==issues== including software ==issues==, computer ==crashes== and hardware trouble. These specialists may also ==assist== senior-level IT ==members== with larger-scale network issues.
- **Network systems administrators** focus on the big ==picture== of the network system, security and ==performance==.
- **Computer systems analysts** work ==behind== the ==scenes== to ==marry== IT with smart business ==solutions==. ==They== ==usually== ==specialize== in a particular industry while working for a technology ==firm== or work ==directly== in an industry, like finance or ==government==.
- **Information security analysts** are ==responsible== for the security of an organization’s computer networks, ==conducting== tests and developing ==company-wide== best security practices.

==Keep== in mind that some of these roles ==will== change depending on the size and ==scope== of the company. In smaller companies, ==most== of your ==daily== work may ==revolve== ==around== ==relatively== ==mundane== things like troubleshooting printers, but on the other hand, you may be required to be more of a ==jack-of-all-trades== with ==broader== knowledge. With ==large== ==firms==, IT employees have a more ==diverse== array of potential focus areas—==some== may work ==upward== into management and strategic planning roles, while others may pursue specialized areas like cybersecurity.

## What characteristics are employers looking for in IT candidates?

Candidates who are best ==suited== for IT work are ==those== who have strong communication skills. From helping ==executives== develop ==sophisticated== technological ==solutions== to troubleshooting a network issue, those in information technology need to have a level of ==empathy== that ==allows== them to see ==exactly== what a client or co-worker is ==dealing== with and ==calmly== help ==them== achieve ==their== goal or ==solve== a problem.

This may ==mean== ==breaking down== a ==large== problem or an end goal into ==multiple== steps so that the ==stakeholder== can see ==exactly== what it will take to ==accomplish== it. Taking time to ==define== and ==explain== what’s ==needed== can help an IT department ==better== manage ==stakeholders==’ ==expectations== and maximize the department’s hours in the best way ==possible==, ==according== to Keri Peterson, IT business analyst and project manager at [University of Northwestern-St. Paul](https://unwsp.edu/). Many businesses want to use technology as a ==means== to an end, and a competent IT department can help ==them== get there.

A positive attitude and ==passion== for technology can help an IT ==employee== succeed and advance. Jack Bedell-Pearce, managing director of [4D Data Centres](https://www.4d-dc.com/), says that the combination of these ==traits== will ==foster== ==greater== ==responsibilities==. Plus, this ==passion== for technology ==will== make ==staying== up to date on the ==latest== technology and advancements—another must for the IT professional—==much== ==easier== and ==enjoyable==.

## Are you a ==fit== for an IT ==career==?

Now that you’ve ==got== a ==better== ==handle== on the basics of what information technology is and the ==important== nature of the field, you might be ==wondering== ==whether== a tech ==career== is the right ==fit== for you.
